What is Tailwind
	- CSS Framework made up of utility classes
	- lower level than bootstrap
	- quickly make nice looking webpages
	- more flexibility in designing custom looks compared to bootstrap
	

Installing Tailwind
	1) Through npm
	
	
		1) Create project directory
		2) npm init -y
		3) npm install tailwindcss
		

How Tailwind works?

	1) source file written (styles.css)
		- import all tailwind core styles & functionalities
		- can also write own custom css (if want to)
			- including tailwind syntax & features
			
	2) Use tailwind to process source file
		- converts it to vanilla css public file 
		- (because tailwind syntax is different from pure vanilla css)
		
	3) Link index.html to public vanilla css file
	
	
	* Tailwind utility class typically written in html file
		- source css file rarely edited
		
	4) Create "src" & "public" folder
		src folder: where source files will be located
			- styles.css

	
		public folder: where final files will be located	
			- compiled tailwind styles.css
			- index.html
			- front end JS
			- images etc.
			
			* Public folder eventually deployed to webhost on internet
	
	5) create styles.css in src dir
		@tailwind base;
		@tailwind components;
		@tailwind utilities;
		
	6) Go to package.json for "scripts" & add:
		"build-css": "tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/styles.css"
		
	7) "npm run build-css" to execute script in terminal
		- outputs file styles.css with all utility classes within
		- can be used in html files for styling
